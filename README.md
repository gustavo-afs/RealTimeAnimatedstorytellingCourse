#Project Description

All course modules are separated by it's own directory, except for the modules 1 and 2 that are located at the same directory ./Animated Story

At the end of each chapter I completed a challenge that can be found at the ./Creative Challenges directory! ![alt text](Unit7_StarterFiles_2019.4/Recordings/image_0015.png)
